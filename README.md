# Postacard

# Me

# The Genesis

    * I wanted to learn NodeJS (back in 2015)
    * I was looking for a sideproject to build

# The idea


# Postacard.ch
A mix of two products:
    
    * PostCard Creator (by the Swiss Post)
    * Instagram

## PostCard Creator

 > Produce your post card mailing online with PostCard Creator.
 
    * [A web app](https://postcardcreator.post.ch)
    * [A mobile app](https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/postcard-creator/id820354055?mt=8)

> With PostCard Creator, send one free postcard every 24 hours.


## Instagram
Did I need to present this application?


## What is Postacard
Send Instagram photo as a real postcard by just adding a custom hashtag (eq: <code>#postacard</code> or <code>grandma</code>).

Postacard.ch let you map a specific hashtag with a (Postal) Address.

(Postacard will queue the delivery to use the free sending each 24h.)

# How to build it ?

    * Sadly, PostCard Creator don't offer an open API.
    * But an undocumented API exist !

# Reverse Engineering

    * Charles Web Debugging Proxy: https://www.charlesproxy.com/ or Wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/)
    * Tools to simulate human interactions
    * Postman
    * Times

## HTTP Debugger
    * Charles Web Debugging Proxy

## Simulate humain interactions
    * HTML Scrapping (Extract data from HTML).
        - request + cheerio (nodejs), requests + lxml (python), ...
    * Fonctional testing tools
